    "text": "This blog post explores the distribution of various languages spoken across the continent of Africa. The data was sourced from the tidytuesday Github repository, curated by Muwanga Robert: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2026/2026-01-13/readme.md.\nThe data set consists of a variable for language which contains the name of an African language, a variable for family which contains a classification of that language according to ancestry, phonetics and grammar, a variable for native speakers which contains the total number of known native speakers of that language across the continent, and finally a variable for country which contains the name of the country where the language is spoken.\nThe question of interest for this exploration is: what is the language that has the most native speakers in Africa, and which region of Africa is it most spoken in?\nTo answer this question, a lollipop plot will be made to visualize the top 10 languages with the most native speakers, and the distribution of the one with the highest number of native speakers will be visualized on a map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar plot shows Arabic to be the language with the most native speakers on the African continent by almost 3 times the number of native speakers of Hausa, which is the language that follows it in ranking by native speakers.\nThis is a surprising finding for me because I had expected Swahili to be one of the top 2 African languages with most native speakers. It is not so because although it is very widely spoken, a lot of its speakers speak it as a second or third language; they are not native speakers.\nHere is a map to visualize the distribution of Arabic across the African continent.\n\n\n\n\n\nReading layer `ne_10m_admin_0_countries' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\sefal\\OneDrive - St. Lawrence University\\SPRING 2026\\DATA334\\DataVis334\\countries\\ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 258 features and 168 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -180 ymin: -90 xmax: 180 ymax: 83.6341\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the map, it can be seen that countries that have native Arabic speakers are mostly in Northern Africa, except for Tanzania, Somalia and Djibouti which are in East Africa. This is likely the result of the 7th-8th century Arab-Islamic Expansion where Arab Muslim armies expanded out of the Arabian Peninsula into mostly Northern Africa and parts of East Africa.\n\n\n\nThe flaw in my approach to visualizing the distribution of countries that have native speakers of Arabic is that from first glance, and without prior understanding of the context of the visualization, a viewer might perceive the map as though it means the countries colored purple have Arabic as the only spoken language, whereas it is just one of the languages spoken in those countries. What this visualization was meant to do is to show which countries have native Arabic speakers.\nIf I had additional data on the number of native speakers for each language in every country it is spoken in, I would change the map to have a sequential color scheme to visualize the distribution of Arabic speakers across the continent according to their numbers."
